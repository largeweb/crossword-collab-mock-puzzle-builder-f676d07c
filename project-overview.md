# Project Overview

Project Name: Crossword Collab (Mock Puzzle Builder)

Description: A web application that *simulates* collaborative crossword puzzle creation and solving. Users can "invite" friends to join their puzzle and work together in real-time. Puzzle data and game progress are mocked on the frontend.

Features:

*   Puzzle Size Selection: Users can choose from predefined grid sizes (e.g., 10x10, 15x15, 20x20).
*   Word Placement: A drag-and-drop interface to place words onto the grid (with validation to ensure they fit).
*   Clue Creation: Input fields for writing clues for each word.
*   "Real-time" Collaboration: A mocked interface showing multiple cursors and simulated updates from other players.
*   Puzzle Solving: An interactive grid where users can type in their answers.
*   Check Solution:  A button to reveal the correct answers (for demonstration purposes).
*   Invite Friends: A button to simulate sharing with friends.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
